        <h1>Caleb the Theologian</h1>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in the Church and have always felt inclined to
          think deeply about the truths with which she has been entrusted. Most
          of my academic and writing pursuits center around theology, the Bible,
          philosophy, and ethics. I have had several blogs over the years, and I
          have written countless essays and papers for both my undergrad and
          graduate studies. Here are the highlights (the older papers do not
          always reflect my current views but do reflect my current modes of
          writing and thinking):
